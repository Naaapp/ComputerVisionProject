1.2: Edges detection:
=====================

- Gradient of Beucher
- Non Linear Laplacian
- Canny
	=> vanilla
	=> canny less
	=> canny median blur
	=> canny gaussian blur
- Sobel

BEST : canny median/gaussian blur

1.3: Segment and endpoints:
===========================

- Proba Hough Transform
- LSD

BEST : LSD

1.4: Classification of Points:
=============================

- Theo and Joachim' method

1.5: Test on database:
======================

- Soccer : preprocessing
- sudoku : remove number + remove double edges
- road : road line + traffic lane (+ traffic sign)
- building : main axis + windows and edges of building
- pcb : get as many components as possible



TASKS:
=====

Remaining tasks:
----------------
- Check page number
- Check everything works well
- Remove main in files
- Pros and cons of each method
- What imagse do we use in the notebook? Those must be send with the notebook.

Theo:
-----
- clean up canny
- display canny results on notebook
- create the final edge detecton using the best canny
- Explain the classification method
- Clean up names of variable between method

Bardhyl:
-------
- Sobel : do we keep it or not? Explain and display in notebook if yes
- PCB : check what works well and what doesn't (u don't have to make it work)

Joachim:
-------
- Clean up proba hough transform
- Sudoku

Julien:
-------
- explain hox to download the library LSD on notebook
- create final seg detection fct using LSD
- building

Quentin:
--------
- explain and display result of preprocessing for soccer
- road
