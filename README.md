# 1. Part 1 
## 1.2 Edge points extraction

Following is the table containing the different methods used for edge points extraction.

| Author | Method | Description | Useful links |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Bardhyl |  |  |  |
| Joachim | Morphological gradient (Gradient of Beucher) |  | [wikipedia : morphological gradient] <br> [OpenCV : morphological gradient]|
| Julien |  |  |  |
| Quentin |  |  |  |
| Th√©o | Canny Algorithm |  | [wikipedia : canny edge detector] <br> [OpenCV : canny edge detector] |

# 2. Additional instructions about the project

- **Plagiarism** : Mr. Van Droogenbroeck was very clear that hee takes it very seriously. It is ok to take code (or to be inspired by code) from the internet but he expects us to  mention the authors. He will take STRONG actions against plagiarism (zero from the whole group for example...) .
- **Code** : There will be constraint on the environnment used for the project.
- **Report** : It should at most be 6 pages long. We need to keep it short.
- **Presentation** : We can do a demo at the presentation => I think he would give us more points if we did.
- **Part 1 report** : We don't need to do a performance evaluation in this part.
