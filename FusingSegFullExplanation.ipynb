    "### 1.3.3 Fusing adjacent segments\n",
    "\n",
    "The segment detection used previously is not prefect. One of the imprefection lays in the fact of mutliple segments drawn close to each other to describe the same unique edge. In order to solve this problem, 'close segments' will be fused together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The segments detected are given in the cartesian space with its two endpoints which makes it difficult to characterize the closeness of two edges. In contrast, the Hough space can easily describe the distance between two segments and fuse them if needed. Thus, the idea of the algorithm is to map the segments in a variant of the Hough space, fuse all close segments then map the segments back to the cartesian space.\n",

    "Let's take the example of one segment described by the two points: $A = (a_v, a_h)$ and $B = (b_v, b_h)$ where $(i,j)$ is the point with $i$ in vertical value and $j$ in horizontal values and the origin is fixed at the top left corner of the image.\n",
